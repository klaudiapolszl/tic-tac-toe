Personal solution to the further practice of Reactâ€™s tic-tac-toe tutorial.

<ul>
<li> Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list. </li>
<li> Mark the currently selected item in the move list. </li>
<li> Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them. </li>
<li> When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw. </li>
<li> Style the app using SASS </li>
</ul>
